# Postman_API_Internship_Tasks 🚀

This repository contains a set of API testing tasks completed as part of my internship program using **Postman**. The tasks include RESTful API testing, assertions, parameterization, and environment setup. The goal is to improve my understanding of API behavior and automation with Postman.

---

## 🌟 Welcome!
As an intern working with API testing, I used **Postman** to explore REST APIs by creating automated tests and environments. This repository reflects my progress and the skills I’ve gained during this learning experience.

Would you like me to:
- Generate a `README.md` file for download?
- Help you rename your exported Postman files to look professional?
- Suggest some badges (e.g., Postman, JSON) to add style to your README?

Let me know and I’ll do it!
